Justin the Dustbin is a solar powered dustbin which is able to open and close with the simple swipe of a human hand and can accurately tell how much free space there is left in the dustbin. It is also equipped with UVC LEDs which helps it to sterilize the waste. Not only that, but also it is equipped with a smart lock that wonâ€™t unlock if a person tries to open a full bin
